# COVID-19 Cases Per Country Dashboard
This dashboard is meant to supplement the amazing work that has been done by [JHU](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) by allowing you to compare the outbreak timelines for different countries.

The dashboard here pulls in data from the JHU [GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) repository.
